<h1>Zhongli</h1>
<p> Zhongli is the latest mortal vessel of the Geo Archon, Morax, who serves as a consultant for the Wangsheng Funeral Parlor. To the people of Liyue, their Archon carries many titles: the Geo Archon, the God of Contracts, the God of History, the God of the Stove, the Stonebreaker, and the Warrior God among them.</p>

<p>Having lived for over 6000 years, Zhongli has first-hand experience with much of Teyvat's history, including the start of the Archon War. At the time, Zhongli was the co-ruler of the prosperous Guili Assembly alongside the God of Dust, Guizhong. During a certain battle, despite their efforts and the aid of the adepti, Guizhong was slain and the Guili Assembly was destroyed. Sometime afterwards, 3700 years ago, Zhongli moved his people south of Mt. Tianheng and established Liyue Harbor, where it stands to this day.</p>
